# Debiasing

Methods for a new debiasing of the Galaxy Zoo 2 data. Originally by @RossHart. 

## Order of operations

1. **`code missing?`** Adaptively bin galaxies in redshift to maintain constant number of well
classified galaxies (?) per bin
2. **`code missing?`** Voronoi bin galaxies within each redshift bin in terms of absolute magnitude
and size
3. `Function_fitting.py`
4. `function_to_function.py`
5. `F_to_f_deb.py`

Note that `Debiasing_bin_by_bin_.py` appears to be an old version.
